# Evolution_Simulator
Senior project for CS which simulates an evolving predator-prey system. Entities are controlled by a neural network which mutates every generation

Neural network is implimented from scratch and uses no libraries outside of the STL.
At any point in time in the simulation, an entity is highlighted and it's neural network is displayed in real-time.
Predators reproduce when they eat a prey, and prey reproduce every few hundred game ticks.
Entities have 2D vision and have a specified field of view.
